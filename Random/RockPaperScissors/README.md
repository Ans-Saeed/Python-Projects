# RockPaperScissors

This folder contains a Python implementation of the classic game [Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors). The game is played against the computer, which makes its choice randomly.

## Usage

To play the game, simply run the `rock_paper_scissors.py` file in your Python interpreter or IDE. The game will prompt you to choose either rock, paper, or scissors, and will then display the computer's choice and the outcome of the game.
